CharGen
=============
This project is a character creator and digital sheet viewer for pen and paper RPGs on Android 4.0 and up.


About
=============
My goal was too keep maximal flexibility so that it could easily be fitted for many similar games.
This is my first Android project so don't expect the greatest work.

There are two parts to this project:
	1. Character creator: automate the process in a multi-step phase for each level
	2. Character sheet: be able to view a created/saved character and keep records of various information


Building
=============
There are no special build tools/requirements needed, just the standard Android SDK compatible with Android version 4.3.
Since I'm doubtlessly worse at explaining how to build stuff please refer to the official Android site.

Version
=============
0.1 (warning unstable and incomplete, will probably not compile)
